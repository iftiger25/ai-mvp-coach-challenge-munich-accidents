# Data
*.csv # You might want to ignore the original large CSV if it's too big,
      # but for this challenge, keeping it might be okay.
      # If you decide to ignore it, ensure you document where to get it.

# Model artifacts (if saved separately and large)
# For this challenge, we'll keep the model save in requirements.txt
# and then upload the saved model file itself.
# However, for larger models, you'd use Git LFS or object storage.
